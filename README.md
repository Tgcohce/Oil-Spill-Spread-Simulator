# Oil Spill Spread Simulator

Most Creative Design Winner in Ocean Of Data Challenge: Halting The Harbor [https://deepsense.ca/ocean-of-data-challenge/]

This is a model based on Wave, Wind, Current, Tide, Ship traffic data to predict oil spill spread in halifax harbor.

It calculates each of the effects of above mentioned on the water alongside buoyancy effect. In order to get a net effect on each of these weather factor on a potential oil spill and it simulates their spread.

### Objective
The objective of the data challenge was to focus on rare events in the halifax harbor. I decided to chosoe oil/pollutant spill spreads on the water in the halifax harbor.
It was created in mind to create a simple framework for ocean scientists to create basic spills on. It has a lot of room for improvement and feel free to fork or contribute to it.

### Output
The output the program gives us 4 subplots, a scatter plot, a density plot, a histogram for particles travelled and a direction/arrow diagram. It also has text output that is a range of latitude and longtitude coordinates of the predicted current location of where the pollutant has spread.
